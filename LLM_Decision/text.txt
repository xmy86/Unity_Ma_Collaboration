Scene Overview:
- Evader Position: (x1, y1)
- Target Position: (x2, y2)
- Pursuer Position: (x3, y3)
- Obstacles and Fences: [Detailed description of locations or a list of coordinates]

Description:
1. Evader Position: The evader is positioned at coordinates (x1, y1).
2. Target Position: The target is located at coordinates (x2, y2).
3. Pursuer Position: The pursuer is situated at coordinates (x3, y3).
4. Obstacles and Fences: [Detailed description of locations or a list of coordinates]

Analysis:
- The scene is a 2D layout with the evader, target, and pursuer positioned along the horizontal axis.
- The pursuer is to the right of the evader and target, indicating a strategic position for capturing the evader.
- The obstacles and fences could act as challenges for the pursuer, potentially aiding in the evader's movement.
- The pursuer should plan a path to bypass these obstacles and fences to successfully capture the evader.


prompt1:
        To assist the pursuer in making decisions, please refer to the task description and the scene overview to describe the scene.

        description:
        The entire scene is constructed in Unity software, 
        with the center point at (x=0,z=0). 
        The vertical distance between the four fences and the center point is 5, 
        and the vertical distance between the obstacles and the center point is 2, 
        and the length is 4. The green evader coordinates are (x=0,z=-3.5). 
        The red pursuer coordinates are (x=0,z=3.5).

        task:
        While the green evader agent is moving towards the yellow target, 
        the red pusuer agent can autonomously plan a path based on the real-time position of the evader and the position of the yellow target, 
        bypass obstacles and fences, 
        and intercept and capture the evader.

        You should:

        - Analyze the input data to understand the scene configuration.
        - Describe the relationships between the evader, the pursuer, the target, and obstacles.

        Output your analysis in the following memo format:

        Scene Overview:
        - Evader Position: (x=?, y=?)
        - Target Position: (x=?, y=?)
        - Pursuer Position: (x=?, y=?)
        - Obstacles and Fences: 

        Description:
        1. Describe the current positions of the evader, pursuer, and target.
        2. Analyze the spatial arrangement of obstacles and fences.
        3. Highlight any regions that may restrict movement or create strategic advantages/disadvantages.

        Ensure your output is clear and focused on describing the scene, without providing specific strategic advice or decisions.
